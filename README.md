# 🧱 LEGO Data Analysis using SQL & PostgreSQL

This project explores LEGO's dataset using **advanced SQL queries**, including **data cleaning, database optimization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** in **PostgreSQL**. It uncovers trends in LEGO sets, parts, and themes over the years.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Demonstrate **Data Engineering** and **Data Analysis** skills using **PostgreSQL** by structuring, optimizing, and querying a relational database.

---

## 📌 Project Stages

### 1️⃣ **Database Structure & Relationships**
- **Modeled relational database** based on [Rebrickable LEGO Database](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/).
- Established **primary and foreign keys** to define relationships between sets, parts, and colors.

### 2️⃣ **Key SQL Queries**
- 📂 **List all tables** and their relationships.
- 🔑 **Identify foreign keys** and dependencies between entities.
- 🔄 **Count records** per table to understand dataset size.

### 3️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- 🔍 **How many LEGO sets exist per year?**
- 🎨 **What are the most commonly used LEGO colors?**
- 📊 **What are the most popular LEGO themes?**
- 🔢 **How has the number of pieces per set evolved over time?**
